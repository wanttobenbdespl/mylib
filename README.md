1.Introduction
Text information extraction in images is a key technology for many application scenarios. In this report, we will introduce how to implement the detection and extraction of image text using the OpenCV and Tesseract OCR engines. At the same time, we will analyze the accuracy of the detection results and the running efficiency of the whole model.
2. Technical background
2.1 OpenCV
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision library, providing a wide range of powerful tools and algorithms for tasks such as image processing, video analysis, and machine learning. Its rich features allow developers to use them efficiently in a variety of application scenarios.
2.2 Tesseract OCR
The Tesseract OCR Engine is an open-source system that was developed originally at HP ,now developed mostly at Google.  Despite its age,some of the components of Tesseract are surprisingly similar to more modern approaches. Among other things, the history of the development of Tesseract is a microcosm of the debate over statistical vs non-statistical classification methods. This paper provides a historical perspective, with concentration on the important lessons learned during Tesseract's development, covering both successes and failures, with a view to guiding others how to build an OCR system. It also compares the methods used with those that have been fashionable in recent times.
3. The experimental environment
3.1 Software environment
This experiment was performed on the Google Colab platform, using the following libraries:
OpenCV: For image processing and contour detection.
NumPy: used for numerical calculations and array operations.
Matplotlib: For the visualization.
Pytesseract: For text recognition.
PIL (Python Imaging Library): used for image manipulation.
